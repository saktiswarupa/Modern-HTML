        <h2>1. Semantic Elements</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduces a set of semantic elements that provide meaning to the structure of a web page. These elements make it easier for search engines, screen readers, and developers to understand the content's purpose.</p>
        <p>For example, the &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; tags help organize content more logically and improve accessibility.</p>
    </article>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Video and Audio Support</h2>
        <p>HTML5 includes native support for embedding video and audio content without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. The &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements allow you to easily include multimedia content on your website.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <video controls width="400">
            <source src="sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <h2>3. Form Enhancements</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduces several form-related enhancements, such as new input types and attributes, that make form validation and user interaction more efficient.</p>
        <p>For instance, the &lt;input&gt; element can now use types like "email," "url," and "number," which trigger built-in validation in modern browsers. Additionally, attributes like "required" and "pattern" allow you to specify validation rules for user input.</p>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" name="" id="" placeholder="email">
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
